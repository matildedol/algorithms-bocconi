Hi! In this repository you can find all the projects I have done for the course **Algorithms for Optimization and Inference** at Bocconi.


**Assignment 1** consists in developing a program to recolor a picture reducing the number of colors, both using a k-means algorithm and designing an IP solved with glpk.
