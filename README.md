Hi! In this repository you can find all the projects I have done for the course **Algorithms for Optimization and Inference** at Bocconi.
**Assignment 1** consists in recoloring a picture reducing the number of colors: first, by implementing Lloyd's heuristic algorithm, and then by modeling the problem as an IP and solving it with glpk.
